## Ingredients

- 2 frozen unsweetened acai packets, broken into pieces
- 1 cup frozen banana
- 1 cup frozen strawberries
- lime juice, optional
- honey, optional
- toppings of choice: honey, fresh fruit, granola, coconut flakes, chia seeds, chia pudding, nut butter
## Method

- To a very strong blender, add the frozen acai packets, frozen banana, and frozen strawberries. For a more tangy taste, add a tiny squeeze of lime. For a more sweet taste, add a little bit of honey.

 - Blend until completely smooth. If you do not have a strong blender, you might need to add a splash of milk but this will make the acai bowl less thick.

-  Once smooth and no chunks, transfer to a bowl.

## Serve

- Load on your favorite toppings and enjoy right away!

(Side Note) Feel free to add any other frozen fruit you like to the acai base. The blend of bananas and strawberries the most preferred because the bananas sweeten it naturally and the strawberries add a bit of tang. You can also add frozen blueberries, frozen mangoes, or frozen raspberries.
# Important

You really need a strong blender that makes smoothie bowls to achieve that thick texture. If your blender is not strong, you will need to add a bit of milk to the blender to get it going which will make the smoothie less thick.
