## Ingredients

- **Bananas:** super ripe bananas give the pancakes their natural sweetness. Make sure they have lots of brown spots!
- **Eggs:** you’ll need 2 eggs in this pancake recipe.
- **Milk:** add moisture with any milk you’d like. I typically use unsweetened almond milk.
- **Oats:** instead of using regular flour, these healthy banana pancakes are made with rolled oats! Feel free to use gluten free rolled oats.
- **Pancake staples:** you’ll also need baking powder to allow the pancakes to get nice and fluffy, plus some cinnamon, vanilla extract & salt for flavor.


- Mix-ins: after making the batter feel free to fold in your fav mix-ins like chopped pecans, diced banana, or even chocolate chips.
- **Toppings:** what’s a stack of fluffy pancakes without toppings?! I love adding pecans, banana slices and a drizzle of peanut butter + pure maple syrup. A dollop of yogurt would also be delicious!
- **Make minis:** make cute little mini pancakes by dropping just 1-2 tablespoons of batter onto your griddle at a time!
## Method

1. **Blend the ingredients.** Yes, you’ll literally add all of the ingredients to a blender and blend on high until smooth!

2. **Let batter sit.** You’ll then want to let the batter sit in your blender for about 2 minutes while you heat up your pan.

3. **Cook & flip.** Add olive oil or coconut oil to a griddle or large nonstick pan and place over medium heat. Add pancake batter 1/3 cup at a time and cook for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and tiny bubbles appear around the edges. Flip and cook 2 minutes more.


## Serve

###### Serve & devour. Serve pancakes with fresh fruit and a drizzle of pure maple syrup if you’d like!
