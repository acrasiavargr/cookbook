## Ingredients

- **Yogurt** – There are a lot of yogurt options for these healthy yogurt parfaits. If you’re looking for something higher in protein with a thicker consistency, Greek yogurt is the way to go. I typically use plain Greek yogurt so I can control the sweetness myself. I prefer whole milk, full-fat yogurt whenever I can find it as I think it has the best flavor and texture and I find it more satisfying than fat-free or low-fat yogurt. But, if you prefer a flavored or vanilla Greek yogurt, or a traditional yogurt, or something with less fat, use what is best for you.
- **Chia seeds** – This addition is optional, but I love it as an easy way to add a bit more nutrition into my yogurt parfait! The soaked chia seeds add bulk, protein, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids with virtually no flavor. When soaked, they do have a texture that is reminiscent of tapioca pearls, but smaller!
- **Fruit** – Fresh berries are great in homemade yogurt parfaits, but you can really use any type of fruit. You can also use frozen fruit if berries aren’t in season, I do this often in the winter months. Or use whatever seasonal fruits are available to you.
- **Granola** – Use your favorite granola or cereal, I love a chocolate chip granola but I will also often use my favorite protein cereal. The granola or cereal is great for added texture and crunch!
- **Honey** – The honey is optional and you could also use maple syrup, agave syrup, or any other sweetener. It also might depend on the other additions to your parfait. If you have fruit and cereal, you may not need honey.
- **Extra boosts** – If you want to add some extra nutrition, staying power, or flavor, add chopped nuts (almonds, walnuts, and pecans are all excellent), chia seeds, hemp seeds, or even mini chocolate chips.
## Method

- 1. **Soak chia seeds.** Add chia seeds to a bowl and let sit with milk until all of the liquid has been soaked up by the seeds.

- 2. **Layer parfait.** Add layers of yogurt to your jar or bowl. Top with some of the chia seed mixture and fruit. Repeat steps. Sprinkle granola or cereal over the fruit and yogurt and drizzle with honey if using and garnish with fresh mint leaves if desired.
