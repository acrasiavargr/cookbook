## Ingredients

* 400g baby mushrooms  
* 12 small carrots (or 2 large carrots, chopped)  
* 10 small shallots or pearl onions, peeled  
* ½ onion, finely minced  
* 1 celery stalk, finely minced  
* 5 garlic cloves, finely minced  
* A few sprigs of fresh thyme  
* 175ml red wine  
* 500ml stock (Chicken stock for the richest flavor, or mushroom stock for vegetarian)  
* 2 tbsp tomato paste  
* 2 tbsp chipotle in adobo sauce (optional, for smoky heat)  
* 2 heaping tbsp all-purpose flour  
* 50g butter  
* Olive oil (for frying)
## Method

* Cut the stems off the mushrooms. Mince the stems finely, and keep the mushroom heads whole.  

* Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, very hot pan. Add the mushroom heads and cook until browned on one side (about 80% cooked). Remove and set aside.  

* In the same pan, melt the butter and stir in the flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns a caramel-brown color, creating a dark, rich roux.  

* Add the minced onion, celery, and minced mushroom stems to the pan. Sauté for a few minutes until softened.  

* Add the garlic and tomato paste, cooking for 2-3 minutes to deepen the flavors.  

* Pour in the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let it reduce for about a minute.  

* Add the stock, thyme sprigs, and chipotle in adobo sauce (if using). Stir well.  

* Add the carrots and shallots or pearl onions. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until the carrots are just fork-tender but still have a slight bite.  

* Return the sautéed mushroom heads to the pan and cook for another 1-2 minutes to warm through and let flavors meld.
