## Ingredients

- 2 cups butter chicken
- 4 garlic naans
- 1/3 cup plain yoghurt
- 1/3 cup diced red onion
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
- 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup Monterrey jack cheese, optional
## Method

- Preheat oven to 176 C.

 - Cut the garlic naan into triangular pieces so it resembles tortilla chips.

- Transfer to a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake for 10 to 12 minutes until golden on the edges and crispy.

 - Take out the oven and add butter chicken on top. If adding cheese, do it at this step and then pop it back in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes just until the cheese is melted.

- Garnish with yogurt, cilantro, red onion, and jalapeno to enjoy!
## Serve
