## Ingredients

- 32 ounces cream cheese room temperature
- 1 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
- 3/4 cup sour cream room temperature
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 4 large eggs room temperature
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 12 to 16 Oreos crushed (to add into batter)
- 24 Oreos, whole (to use as the crust)
## Method

- Preheat oven to 350Â°F or 176.6C.

 - Prepare a cupcake baking sheet by adding a cupcake liner to each one. Then add an Oreo at the bottom of each one to act as the "crust".

- Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or handheld beater, add cream cheese and sugar to the bowl and beat on medium speed until it is creamy and smooth. Then add one egg in at a time along with the vanilla extract and mix until creamy and smooth again. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary to make sure everything is incorporated.

- Then add the vanilla extract, sour cream, cornstarch, salt, and heavy cream. Combine together until smooth.

- Finally, add the crushed Oreos and swirl in with a rubber spatula.

 - Smack the bottom of the bowl a few times to get rid of any air bubbles. Then use an ice cream scoop or large cookie scoop and add the batter on top of the Oreo cookie crust. Fill up the rest.

- Pop in the oven and bake for 15 to 16 minutes or until set.

 - Take out of the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Then transfer to the fridge for 2 hours or overnight until cold to enjoy!
