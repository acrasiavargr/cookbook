BROWNIE BATTER

- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
- 1/4 cup light brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon espresso powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour

SHORTBREAD PIE CRUST

- 2/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1/3 cup granulated white sugar
- 1 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- pinch of salt

PECAN PIE

- 1 1/2 cup pecans, chopped
- 2/3 cup heavy cream
- 2/3 cup light brown sugar 
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
- pinch of salt

## Method

PECAN PIE LAYER

1. To a pan over medium heat, add the pecans, heavy cream, brown sugar, unsalted butter, vanilla extract, and salt.
2. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Transfer to a bowl and allow it to cool to room temperature.

THE BROWNIE LAYER

1. Whisk together the unsalted butter, granulated white sugar, and light brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.
2. Then add the unsweetened cocoa powder, salt, espresso powder, vanilla extract, vegetable oil, and heavy cream. Whisk again and then pop in the microwave for 30 seconds. It shouldn't be hot, just warm. Whisk together to dissolve the sugar and cocoa powder.
3. Once smooth, add the eggs and whisk really well until combined.
4. Now add the all-purpose flour and mix until you have a thick batter consistency.

THE CRUST

1. To a small bowl, add the melted butter, white sugar, all-purpose flour, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Mix together with a rubber spatula until the consistency resembles cookie dough.

ASSEMBLE AND BAKE

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Line a 9x9 baking pan with parchment paper. Press the dough tightly to the bottom of the pan and make sure it's even.
3. Add the brownie batter on top and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Do not overbake. It should still be fudgy in the center.
4. Once out of the oven, allow it to cool to room temperature.
5. Add the pecan pie layer on top and pop in the fridge for 30 minutes, or until set.
6. Once the pecan caramel is set, cut into squares to enjoy!
