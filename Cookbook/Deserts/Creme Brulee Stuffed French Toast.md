## Ingredients

**CUSTARD**

- 1 2/3 cup whole milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean scraped
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

**FRENCH TOAST**

- 12 slices Brioche bread
- 3/4 cup half and half
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, for cooking French toast
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar, for brulee
- powdered sugar
- maple syrup
- berries, optional
## Method

-  Start out by making the custard. To a mixing bowl, whisk together cornstarch, sugar, and salt. Then add all the yolks and beat until it gets lighter in color. Set aside.

-  To a pot over medium heat, add the milk and vanilla extract or vanilla bean. Combine together and heat it just until it starts to bubble on the edges. You do not want to boil it or it will be too hot.

- Take off the heat and slowly add a little in at a time to the batter. This is so you don't shock the egg yolks and cook them. Keep on slowly integrating the warm milk until it's all whisked in and very smooth.

 - Then transfer back to the pot and heat over medium-low heat. Continuously whisk together for a few minutes until it starts to thicken up. Immediately take off the heat and add the butter. Mix together until the butter is melted in and incorporated. Transfer the custard to a bowl.

- Cover and pop in the fridge to chill.

- To a bowl, make the custard for dipping the bread in. Combine half and half, eggs, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Whisk really well until completely smooth and homogenous.

- Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a little bit of butter. If the pan is too hot, the butter will burn so make sure it's not too high.

-  Add custard on top of one slice of Brioche bread. Add another slice of bread on top to seal it.

 - Carefully dip the stuffed bread in the French toast batter, let any excess drip off, and place on the pan.

- Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until golden and toasted and flip over to repeat on the other side. Take off the pan and repeat with the rest.

- Add a light sprinkle of granulated sugar on top of the French toast, just enough to cover the surface. Use a blow torch to brulee the sugar until golden. Let it rest for a few minutes until the sugar hardens.

- Sprinkle with powdered sugar, drizzle with maple syrup on top, or add fresh berries on top to keep it less sweet to enjoy!
